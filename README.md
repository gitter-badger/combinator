# combinator

This project is an experiment in fast term-rewriting in clojure. Its goal is to establish the upper bound on term-rewriting performance in clojure and clojurescript.


It aims to evolve a simple combinator-like system as quickly as possible, in clojure and clojurescript.

# the combinator system

For our benchmarks, we are using the simple combinator-like systems defined at https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/section-3.10 .

These combinators iteratively rewrite a binary tree; each iteration is a pre-order traversal that performs all non-overlapping rewrites.

The nodes in the binary tree consist of either the symbol constant e, or a node with two children that again satisfy the criteria.

In Mathematica notation, these trees are expressed as

```
e        ;; node consistent of single atomic element
e[e]     ;; node consisting of two atomic children 
e[e][e]  ;; two-level tree, with e[e] as the left branch, and e as the right branch
```

The combinators themselves are expressed as rules like

```
e[x_][y_]->x[e[y]][x]
```

where x_ and y_ are wildcards that will match any subtree in those positions. 

Different right-hand-sides of the rules will generate different behavior, in terms of the final result, the pattern of recursion, and ultimately patterns of memory access and method invocation.

For the moment we are using only the sample combinator shown above, but a more rigorous test would enumerate all possible combinators up to a certain rhs tree size.

Starting from the initial condition 

```
e[e[e][e]][e][e]
```

the first three steps of evolution are

```
e[e][e][e[e]][e[e][e]][e]
e[e[e]][e][e[e]][e[e[e]][e]][e]
e[e][e[e]][e[e]][e[e]][e[e][e[e]][e[e]]][e]
```

# Representation and implementation in clojure

In general, and for this rule in particular, the evolution will not reach a fixed-point. Therefore we cannot implement the combinator as a naive recursive function because it will never return.   

Furthermore, we cannot use a recursive function like clojure.walk to drive the traversal, because we will quickly blow the stack.

Zippers are the ideal solution, and most of the work in this project is to optimize the zipper implementation.

To represent the binary trees, we use seq'able datastructures.

Thus,

```
e[e[e][e]][e][e]
```

is represented as

```
`(((:e ((:e :e) :e)) :e) :e)
```

To make the combinator rule as fast as possible, encode the rule in a low-level form

```
(defn sample-combinator
  [x]
  (if (seq? x)
    (let [l1 (first x)]
      (if (seq? l1)
        (if (identical? :e  (first l1))
          (let [l1r (second l1)] (list (list l1r (list :e (second x))) l1r)))))))
```

that checks the structure of an input against the desired structure of e[x_][y_] (equivalently, '((:e ?x) ?y)  ), and returns a new tree if it succeeds.
